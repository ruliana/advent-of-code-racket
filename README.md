# Advent of Code - Racket answers

Those are answers made in Racket (former PLT Scheme) to the [Advent of Code Challenge](http://adventofcode.com/).

I'm doing them to learn Racket so, from time to time, I post here new answers or new ways to do the same thing. If you compare versions or the same file, you can see the my previous answers (I only commit complete code).

Also, I'd like to add comments in the code as a form of "Tutorial", let's see if I can accomplish that :P
